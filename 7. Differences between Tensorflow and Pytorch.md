# Differences between Tensorflow and Pytorch
## 1. SAME Padding in Tensorflow
Same padding is not a good fuction. If there the pad shape is odd number, which would make the bottom right different from other part of the feature maps. Gradually, the difference getting bigger as the model going deeper. 
While in Pytorch, VALID padding as default and try to make padding balanced in all corners.
